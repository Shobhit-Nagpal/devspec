   <p>
       DevSpec is a focused collection of conceptual specifications for building developer tools. 
       Rather than diving straight into code, the aim is to understand what concepts you need to know before building out your tool.
   </p>
   
   <p>
       Each specification outlines the essential features, architectural considerations, and design 
       principles needed for building robust developer tools - from loggers to interpreters and 
       plugin systems.
   </p>

   <h2>Why DevSpec?</h2>
   <p>
       While there are countless tutorials and code examples available, there are not many resource which help you understand the concept itself first. DevSpec 
       bridges this gap by providing clear, conceptual guidelines before a single line of code 
       is written.
   </p>

   <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
   <p>
       Each tool specification includes:
    <br/>
       - Core functionality requirements
    <br/>
       - Key architectural decisions
    <br/>
       - Common pitfalls to avoid
    <br/>
       - Interface considerations
    <br/>
       - Best practices and patterns
   </p>
